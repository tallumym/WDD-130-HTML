        <p>
            George Harrison, born February 25, 1943, in Liverpool, was the lead guitarist in the Beatles, although he could play other instruments
            such as the sitar, Ukulele, voice, and many others. George was the youngest of four children, sister Louise, and two brothers Harold and Peter.
            Georges parents were very supportive of his musical ability and dreams, expessialy his mother, Louise, who loved music.
            Some of Harrison's musical influences included George Formby, Cab Calloway, Django Reinhardt, Carl Perkins, and Slim Whitman.
        </p>
        <p> When Harrison's good friend Paul McCartney joined the Quarymen, Paul tried to get George in the band. But John Lennon being three years older than him, would not let him in the band.
            Until Paul got George to perform the lead guitar part for the instrumenal "Raunchy", John let him in, still being rude to George because of their age gap.
